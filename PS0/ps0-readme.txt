 *
 * There are six examples of academic misconduct, labeled (a) through
 * (f). Other than (a), "Seeks to claim credit for the work or efforts
 * of another without authorization or citation," which of these do you
 * think would most apply to this class, and why? Write approx. 100-200
 * words.
 *
 * Note: there is no single correct answer to this. I am looking for
 * your opinion.
 **********************************************************************/

The one I think would most apply to the class would be the letter B and F. 
This is because we would do work sometimes without any help from the professor, 
and look things up, which leads to uses use some unauthorized materials because 
we have no way of getting help or is just too impatient to wait for a professorâ€™s 
response. As for F it would be because we tend to ask each other for help and help 
each other a lot, and sometimes that includes part of the code which has an error 
in it but you just can't see it, and as such would show other people your code in 
hopes of getting help seeing the problem.

The setup took the longest time, and was the most confusing problem there, especially since my firewall was blocking it.
